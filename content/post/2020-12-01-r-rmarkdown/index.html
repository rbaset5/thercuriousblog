<p>The possession concept, in partiuclar the concept of equal pessessions for oppents in a game, is central to basketball analysis.Estimates of possessions have existed for approximately two
decades, but the various formulas have sometimes created confusion. Iâ€™m looking to study the relationship between poessions and various statistics using estimates to provide a common basis for future posession estimation and discussing concepts like pace and four factors between NBA teams in the ___ for the purposes of this post.</p>
<p>Pace can be analyzed by calculating posessions first and the stricly related statistic accounting for the pace of the game is calculating total minutes played by all the players.</p>
<p>Per-possession efficiency is measured as the poitns scored or alloed per 100 possessions, called Offensive(ORtg) and Defensive (DRtg) Rating, respectively;</p>
<p>ORtg = P T ST /P OSST (2.3) DRtg = PTSO/POSSO (2.4)
where the subscripts T and O refer to whether the statistic is computed on the analyzed team or the opponent(s).</p>

<p>Finally, you have your Four-Factor forumals computing for each of the offense and defense.</p>
